There is a makefile which will help you to make the file needed.
If you want to open the shell, type 
$make shell
$./shell precision//integer, where this integer is the desired digits the monte carlo program is supposed to be.
Then in the shell,

shell$make monte
shell$./monte alarm//float, where it would be the max seconds it will execute for

In the shell, you will be able to use the shell commands other than cd.

NOTE in this shell, when you start the monte carlo program or once you pressed Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Z, if you want to execute monte, you’ll have to type “make monte” again.

You could type “make clean” to delete the executables.
